To convert decimal value x to hexadecimal, we repeatedly devide by 16 giving a quotent q and a reamainder r such that x = q * 16 + 4
r becomes the *least* signficant digit for the hexadecimal value

As an example: x = 314156

  314145 = 19634 * 16 + 12 (C)
   19634 = 1227 * 16 + 2   (2)
    1227 = 76 * 16 + 11    (B)
      76 = 4 * 16 + 12     (C)
       4 = 0 * 16 + 4      (4)

314156 in hexadecimal is 0x4CB2C
