Given that x in decimal form is a power of 2: x = 2 ^ n

Binary form of x is 1 followed by n 0's

Hexadecimal form of x is:
  write n in the form of i + 4j where 0 <= i <= 3
  i is the is a key to get the digit of the hexadecimal form, followed by j 0's
  to get the first digit of the hexadecimal form:
    if i = 0: first digit is 1
    if i = 1: first digit is 2
    if i = 2: first digit is 4
    if i = 3: first digit is 8

Example:

x = 2048
x = 2^11

n      = 11
i + 4j = 11 where 0 <= i <= 3
    4*2 = 8 + 3 = 11
i = 3, j = 2;
answer is: 0x800
